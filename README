A makefile is used to compile it into a LaTeX .pdf and an HTML file via pandoc.

For the HTML, a CSS stylesheet is provided (`style.css`) which:
• Gives a custom background and div settings for the content area.
• Creates a "table of contents" from the section headings and converts that into a menu bar where the subsections drop down.
• Hides some longer content away to reappear on mouseover.

For the LaTeX/pdf, a pandoc LaTeX template file is used with some custom settings as well.
These are located in the `template.tex` file.

𝗨𝘀𝗲
Make changes to the markdown file `index.md`. Run `make` (or `make compile`) and it will produce a .pdf and .html.

𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀
pandoc, LaTeX, and if you want to use the makefile, make (you can copy the commands and run them manually if you want).
