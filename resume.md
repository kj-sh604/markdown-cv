: Deployed a self-hosted searx instance. [justsearx.xyz](https://justsearx.xyz/) is an open-source, privacy-respecting metasearch engine that combines results from other domains and presents them in a single list. Users' search queries and their IP addresses are not logged. Instead, the search query is distributed to a number of different search engines and the results are returned to the user, aggregated and ranked by relevance. This allows users to search the web using multiple search engines at once, while still maintaining their privacy.

## Tools I Use

#### Usual Workflow

I mostly use a **Linux**-based setup in a tiling window manager (**awesomewm**). I am passionate about web access in third-world countries (wherein bandwidth is limited), this is why I prefer to develop and deploy useful yet minimal websites. I am comfortable with a terminal and I utilize tools like **vim**, **ssh**, and **ffmpeg**. I have used Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux systems (both Debian and Arch-based varieties, as well as some experience with Fedora).
